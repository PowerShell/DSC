# DSC extension discover operation stdout schema reference

## Synopsis

Represents the path to a manifest not discoverable in the `PATH` or `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` environment
variables.

## Metadata

```yaml
SchemaDialect: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
SchemaID:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/v3.1.0/extension/stdout/discover.json
Type:          object
```

## Description

Represents the actual state of a resource instance in DSC path to a discovered DSC resource or
extension manifest on the system. DSC expects every JSON Line emitted to stdout for the
**Discover** operation to adhere to this schema.

The output must be a JSON object. The object must define the full path to the discovered manifest.
If an extension returns JSON that is invalid against this schema, DSC raises an error.

If the extension doesn't discover any manifests, it must return nothing to stdout. An empty output
indicates no resources were found.

## Required Properties

The output for the `discover` operation must include these properties:

- [manifestPath](#manifestpath)

## Properties

### manifestPath

The value for this property must be the absolute path to a manifest file on the system. The
manifest can be for a DSC resource or extension. If the returned path doesn't exist, DSC raises an
error.

Each discovered manifest must be emitted as a separate JSON Line to stdout. If no manifests are
discovered, the extension must not emit any output to stdout.

```yaml
Type:     string
Required: true
```
