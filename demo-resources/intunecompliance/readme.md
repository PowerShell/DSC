# Example resource for existing Microsoft InTune custom compliance scripts

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a known scenario.

For anyone that already has authored a custom compliance JSON/script
for use in Microsoft InTune,
it could be a "nice to have" if a DSCv3 resource could re-use
those artifacts.

This does not imply the resource would work as part of the InTune service.

A problem to solve would be where people expect to put the json/ps1 files.

Based on the public documentation found
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/compliance-use-custom-settings).
