title: dsc resource set result (simple)
description: >-
  Describes the return data for a DSC resource instance from the
  `dsc resource set` command. This data is returned for instances that aren't
  group resources, adapter resources, or nested inside a group or adapter
  resource.

  When you use `dsc resource set` for a group or adapter resource, the command
  returns an array of full test result objects that include the name and
  type for the nested instances.

type: object
required:
  - beforeState
  - afterState
  - changedProperties
properties:
  beforeState:
    title: State before enforcing
    description: >-
      This property always represents the desired state of the DSC resource
      instance before the `set` method runs. DSC validates this return value
      against the DSC resource's schema.
    type: object
  afterState:
    title: State after enforcing
    description: >-
      This property always represents the current state of the DSC resource
      instance as returned by its `set` method after enforcing the desired
      state. DSC validates this return value against the DSC resource's schema.
    type: object
  changedProperties:
    title: Changed properties
    description: >-
      This property always represents the list of property names for the DSC
      resource instance that the `set` method modified. When this value is an
      empty array, the `set` method didn't enforce any properties for the
      instance.
