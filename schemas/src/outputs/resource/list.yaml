    # Even though I used the defined type here, I noticed that the Test*
    # resources don't follow that pattern - their type name is just a name,
    # no prefix. Should we have a different schema for those, or should this
    # be relaxed?

    title: Resource capabilities
    description: >-
      Defines the list of DSC operations the resource is compatible with. If the resource doesn't
      list a given operation, like `Set` or `Export`, the resource can't be used for those
      operations. The exception to this is `Test` - DSC uses synthetic testing for resources that
      don't have the `Test` capability.
