  Defines whether the resource is a normal DSC Resource, a group resource, or an adapter
  resource. This property is only required for group resources.

  DSC infers the default value for this property based on whether the [adapter][02] property is
  defined in the manifest:

  - If the `adapter` property is defined in the manifest, the default `kind` is `Adapter`.
  - If the `adapter` property is not defined in the manifest, the default `kind` is `Resource`.

markdownEnumDescriptions:
  - | # Resource
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a standard command-based DSC Resource.
  - | # Adapter
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for an adapter resource that enables the use of
      non-command-based resources with DSC.
  - | # Group
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for a group resource that processes an array of nested
      resource instances.
  - | # Import
      <!-- force a line break -->

      Indicates that the manifest is for an import resource that resolves an external source to DSC
      resource instances. The resolved instances are processed as nested instances for the import
      resource.
