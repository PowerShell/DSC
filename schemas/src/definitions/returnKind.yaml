title: Return Kind
type: string
enum:
  - state
  - stateAndDiff
default: state

$comment: |-
  While the enumeration for return kind is the same for the `set` and `test`
  method, the way it changes the behavior of the command isn't. The description
  keyword isn't included here because the respective schemas for those methods
  document the behavior themselves.
