      title: Fully qualified type name
      description: >-
        Uniquely identifies a DSC resource or extension.
      markdownDescription: |-
        The fully qualified type name of a DSC resource or extension uniquely identifies a resource
        or extension.

        Fully qualified type names use the following syntax:

        ```yaml
        <owner>[.<namespace>...]/<name>
        ```

        Where the type may have zero or more namespace segments for organizing the type. The
        `owner`, `namespace`, and `name` segments must consist only of alphanumeric characters and
        underscores.

        Conventionally, the first character of each segment is capitalized. When a segment
        contains a brand or proper name, use the correct casing for that word, like
        `TailspinToys/Settings`, not `Tailspintoys/Settings`.

        Example fully qualified type names include:

        - `Microsoft/OSInfo`
        - `Microsoft.SqlServer/Database`
        - `Microsoft.Windows.IIS/WebApp`
      patternErrorMessage: >-
        Invalid type name. Valid resource type names always define an owner and a name separated by
        a slash, like `Microsoft/OSInfo`. Type names may optionally include the group, area, and
        subarea segments to namespace the resource under the owner, like
        `Microsoft.Windows/Registry`.

          Defines a valid semantic version (semver)as a string.

      markdownDescription:
        en-us: |-
          Defines a valid semantic version ([semver][01]) as a string.

          This value uses the [suggested regular expression][02] to validate whether the string is
          valid semver. This is the same pattern, made multi-line for easier readability:

          ```regex
          ^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)
          (?:-(
            (?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)
            (?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))
          *))?
          (?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$
          ```

          The first line matches the `major.minor.patch` components of the version. The middle
          lines match the pre-release components. The last line matches the build metadata
          component.

      patternErrorMessage:

          Invalid value, must be a semantic version like `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, such as `1.2.3`.

          The value may also include pre-release version information and build metadata.
