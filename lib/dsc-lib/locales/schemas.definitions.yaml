        Uniquely identifies a DSC resource or extension.
      markdownDescription: |-
        The fully qualified type name of a DSC resource or extension uniquely identifies a resource
        or extension.

        Fully qualified type names use the following syntax:

        ```yaml
        <owner>[.<namespace>...]/<name>
        ```

        Where the type may have zero or more namespace segments for organizing the type. The
        `owner`, `namespace`, and `name` segments must consist only of alphanumeric characters and
        underscores.

        Conventionally, the first character of each segment is capitalized. When a segment
        contains a brand or proper name, use the correct casing for that word, like
        `TailspinToys/Settings`, not `Tailspintoys/Settings`.

        Example fully qualified type names include:

        - `Microsoft/OSInfo`
        - `Microsoft.SqlServer/Database`
        - `Microsoft.Windows.IIS/WebApp`
      patternErrorMessage: >-
        Invalid type name. Valid resource type names always define an owner and a name separated by
        a slash, like `Microsoft/OSInfo`. Type names may optionally include the group, area, and
        subarea segments to namespace the resource under the owner, like
        `Microsoft.Windows/Registry`.

          Defines a valid semantic version ([semver][01]) as a string.

          This value uses the [suggested regular expression][02] to validate whether the string is
          valid semver. This is the same pattern, made multi-line for easier readability:

          ```regex
          ^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)
          (?:-(
            (?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)
            (?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))
          *))?
          (?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$
          ```

          The first line matches the `major.minor.patch` components of the version. The middle
          lines match the pre-release components. The last line matches the build metadata
          component.

          Invalid value, must be a semantic version like `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, such as `1.2.3`.

          The value may also include pre-release version information and build metadata.

          Defines one or more limitations for a semantic version to enable version pinning.

          DSC uses the semantic version requirements for Rust, as documented in the
          ["Specifying dependencies" section of the Cargo Book][01]. DSC adheres closely to the
          Rust syntax for defining semantic version requirements, with the following exceptions:

          1. DSC semantic version requirements _forbid_ the inclusion of build metadata.

            Rust allows and ignores them. DSC forbids the inclusion of build metadata to limit confusion
            and unexpected behavior when specifying a version requirement for a DSC resource or
            extension.
          1. DSC semantic version requirements _must_ define a major version segment. All other segments
            are optional.

            Rust technically supports specifying a wildcard-only version requirement (`*`). DSC forbids
            specifying this version requirement as it maps to the default version selection and is
            discouraged when specifying version requirements for production systems.
          1. DSC semantic version requirements only support the asterisk (`*`) character for wildcards,
            not `x` or `X`.

            DSC forbids specifying wildcards as non-asterisks to reduce ambiguity and unexpected
            behavior for prerelease segments, where `1.2.3-X` and `1.2.3-rc.x` are _valid_ requirements
            but where the characters are _not_ interpreted as wildcards. Forbidding the use of these
            characters prevents users from accidentally defining a requirement they _believe_ will
            wildcard match on a prerelease segment but actually won't.

          [Defining semantic version requirements][01].
