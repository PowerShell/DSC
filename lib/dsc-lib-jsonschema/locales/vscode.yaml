        Defines a meta schema combining Draft 2020-12 and the VS Code extended vocabulary.

        The VS Code extended vocabulary enables you to define custom keywords that enhance how VS
        Code interprets schemas to provide better hover documentation, IntelliSense, validation
        errors, and more.

        Defines custom keywords for enhancing the authoring and editing experience for data files
        in VS Code.

        These custom keywords don't affect the validation of data. Instead, they provide
        annotations that VS Code interprets to provide better hover documentation, IntelliSense,
        validation errors, and more.

  keywords:
    allowComments:
      title:
        en-US: Allow comments
      description:
        en-US: >-
          Indicates whether VS Code should allow comments in the JSON file, even when the file
          extension isn't '.jsonc'.
      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Indicates whether VS Code should allow comments in the JSON file, even when the file
          extension isn't `.jsonc`.

          By default, JSON comments in `.json` files cause parsing errors. If you define a JSON
          Schema with `allowComments` set to `true`, VS Code doesn't raise validation errors for
          comments in JSON for that schema.

    allowTrailingCommas:

      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Indicates whether VS Code should allow trailing commas in the JSON file.

          By default, a comma after the last item in an array or last key-value pair in an object
          causes a parsing error. If you define a JSON Schema with `allowTrailingCommas` set to
          `true`, VS Code doesn't raise validation errors for commas after the last item in arrays
          or last key-value pair in objects for that Schema.

          the `title` keyword as code-formatted text.
      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Defines additional information for IntelliSense when completing a proposed item, replacing
          the `title` keyword as code-formatted text.

          By default, when a user completes a value for a schema or subschema, VS Code displays
          additional information in hover text. If the schema defines the `title` keyword, the
          hover text includes the title string as the first line of the hover text.

          If you define the `completionDetail` keyword, VS Code displays the string as monospace
          code-formatted text instead of the `title` keyword's value.

          If the schema defines the `description` or `markdownDescription` keywords, that text is
          displayed in the hover text after the value from the `completionDetail` or `title`
          keyword.

      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Provides snippets for completion of a schema or subschema value or property.

          By default, VS Code presents a set of completion options for data with an associated JSON
          Schema like suggesting defined property names or enum values. You can use the
          `defaultSnippets` keyword to provide an array of snippets with more control over the
          presentation, default values, and enable users to quickly fill out the snippet.

          The keyword expects an array of objects that each define a snippet. For more information
          about defining snippets, see [Define snippets in JSON Schemas][01]. For more information
          about the snippet syntax, see [Snippet syntax][02].

        markdownDescription:
          en-US: |-
            Each item defines a snippet for users that VS Code will surface as part of IntelliSense.

            Every snippet must define either the `body` or `bodyText` property, which VS Code uses
            to insert the snippet into the data file. If you specify both `body` and `bodyText`, the
            value for `body` supercedes the value for `bodyText`.
            
            The `description`, and `markdownDescription` properties provide documentation for the
            snippet and are displayed in the hover text when a user selects the snippet. If you
            specify both `description` and `markdownDescription`, the text for
            `markdownDescription` supercedes the text for `description`.

            The `label` property defines a short name for the snippet. If the snippet doesn't define
            the `label` property, VS Code shows a stringified representation of the snippet instead.
            
            Snippets are presented to the user in alphabetical order by the value of their `label`
            property (or the stringified representation of the snippet if it has no label).

                Defines a short name for the snippet instead of using the stringified representation
                of the snippet's value. The `label` property also affects the order that VS Code
                presents the snippets. VS Code sorts the snippets for completion alphabetically by
                label.

                Defines plain text documentation for the snippet displayed in the completion dialog.
                
                When the snippet doesn't define the `description` or `markdownDescription` property,
                the snippet provides no additional context to the user aside from the label until
                they select the snippet for completion. Use the `description` property to provide
                information to the user about the snippet. If you need to provide rich formatting,
                like links or text formatting, use the `markdownDescription` property.

                If you define both the `description` and `markdownDescription` property for a
                snippet, the `markdownDescription` text overrides the `description` text.

                like links or text formatting, use the `markdownDescription` property.

                If you define both the `description` and `markdownDescription` property for a
                snippet, the `markdownDescription` text overrides the `description` text.

                Defines the data to insert for the snippet. The data can be any type. When the user
                selects the snippet, VS Code inserts the data at the cursor. In string literals for
                the `body` you can use [snippet syntax][01] to define tabstops, placeholders, and
                variables.

                Alternatively, you can define the `bodyText` property for the snippet, which
                specifies the text to insert for the snippet as a string.

                If you define both the `bodyText` and `body` properties for a snippet, the `body`
                definition overrides the `bodyText` property.

          Defines a message to surface as a warning to users when they specify a deprecated property
          in their data.

          This keyword only has an affect when defined in a schema or subschema that also defines
          the `deprecated` keyword as `true`. When you define the `deprecationMessage` keyword for
          a deprecated schema or subschema, VS Code displays the provided message instead of the
          default warning about deprecation.

    doNotSuggest:
      title:
        en-US: Do not suggest
      description:

      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Indicates whether VS Code should avoid suggesting the property for IntelliSense.

          By default, VS Code will show any defined property in the `properties` keyword as a
          completion option with IntelliSense. You can define the `doNotSuggest` keyword in a
          property subschema as `true` to indicate that VS Code should not show that property for
          IntelliSense.

    enumDescriptions:
      title:
        en-US: Enum descriptions
      description:
        en-US: >-
          Defines per-value descriptions for schemas that use the enum keyword.
      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Defines per-value descriptions for schemas that use the `enum` keyword.

          The builtin keywords for JSON Schema includes the `description` keyword, which you can use
          to document a given schema or subschema. However, for schemas that use the `enum` keyword
          to define an array of valid values, JSON Schema provides no keyword for documenting each
          value.

          With the `enumDescriptions` keyword from the VS Code vocabulary, you can document each
          item in the `enum` keyword array. VS Code interprets each item in `enumDescriptions` as
          documenting the item at the same index in the `enum` keyword.

          This documentation is surfaced in VS Code on hover for an enum value and for IntelliSense
          when completing an enum value.

          If you want to use Markdown syntax for the annotation, specify the
          `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword instead.

    enumDetails:
      title:
        en-US: Enum details
      description:

      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Defines additional information for IntelliSense when completing a proposed enum value,
          shown before the description.

          By default, when VS Code suggests a completion for an item defined in the `enum` keyword,
          VS Code displays hover text with a description. If the schema defined the `description`,
          `enumDescriptions`, or `markdownEnumDescriptions` keywords, VS Code displays that text.
          The `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword overrides the `enumDescriptions` keyword, which
          overrides the `description` keyword.

          When you define the `enumDetails` keyword, VS Code displays the string for that enum
          value as monospace code-formatted text. The keyword expects an array of strings. VS Code
          correlates the items in the `enumDetails` keyword to the items in the `enum` keyword by
          their index. The first item in `enumDetails` maps to the first item in `enum` and so on.

    enumSortTexts:
      title:
        en-US: Enum sort text
      description:

      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Defines a alternate strings to use when sorting a suggestion for enum values.

          By default, suggestions are sorted alphabetically, not in the order that you define
          items in the `enum` keyword array. You can use the `enumSortText` keyword to override
          the order the values are displayed, providing a different string for each value.

          The keyword expects an array of strings. VS Code correlates the items in the
          `enumSortText` keyword to the items in the `enum` keyword by their index. The first item
          in `enumSortText` maps to the first item in `enum` and so on.

          For example, in the following schema, VS Code will suggest the `baz`, then `bar`, then
          `foo` values:

          ```json
          {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["foo", "bar", "baz"],
              "enumSortText": ["c", "b", "a"]
          }
          ```

    errorMessage:
      title:

          Defines a friendly error message to raise when a schema or subschema fails validation.
      markdownDescription:
        en-US: |-
          Defines a friendly error message to raise when a schema or subschema fails validation.

          By default, VS Code surfaces a default error message for data that fails schema
          validation, like specifying an invalid type. You can use the `errorMessage` keyword to
          define a custom message to raise in the editor when the data fails validation for the
          following cases:

          - When the data is an invalid type as validated by the `type` keyword.
          - When the subschema defined for the `not` keyword is valid.
          - When the data is invalid for the defined values in the `enum` keyword.
          - When the data is invalid for the defined value in the `const` keyword.
          - When a string doesn't match the regular expression defined in the `pattern` keyword.
            This message is overridden by the `patternErrorMessage` keyword if it's defined.
          - When a string value doesn't match a required format.
          - When the data is for an array that is validated by the `minContains` or `maxContains`
            keywords and fails those validations.
          - When the data includes a property that was defined in the `properties` keyword as
            `false`, forbidding the property.
          - When the data includes a property that was defined in the `patternProperties` keyword as
            `false`, forbidding matching property names.
          - When the data includes a property that wasn't defined in the `properties` or
            `patternProperties` keyword and the schema defines `additionalProperties` as `false`.
          - When the data includes a property that isn't evaluated by any keywords and the schema
            defines `unevaluatedProperties` as `false`.

          The value for the `errorMessage` keyword supercedes all default messages for the schema
          or subschema where you define the keyword. You can provide per-validation failure
          messages by defining the validating keywords in separate entries of the `allOf` keyword
          and defining the `errorMessage` keyword for each entry.

      markdownDescription:

          Defines documentation for the schema or subschema displayed as hover text in VS Code.

          By default, VS Code displays the text defined in the `description` keyword in the hover
          text for properties and values. VS Code interprets the `description` keyword literally,
          without converting any apparent markup.

          You can define the `markdownDescription` keyword to provide descriptive text as markdown,
          including links and code blocks. When a schema or subschema defines the
          `markdownDescription` keyword, that value supercedes any defined text in the `description`
          keyword.

          You can also use the `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword to document the values defined
          for the `enum` keyword.

          Defines documentation for enum values displayed as hover text in VS Code.

          By default, when a user hovers on or selects completion for a value that is validated by
          the `enum` keyword, VS Code displays the text from the `description` or
          `markdownDescription` keywords for the schema or subschema. You can use the
          `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword to define documentation for each enum value.

          When a schema or subschema defines the `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword, that value
          supercedes any defined text in the `description`, `markdownDescription`, or
          `enumDescriptions` keywords.

          The keyword expects an array of strings. VS Code correlates the items in the
          `markdownEnumDescriptions` keyword to the items in the `enum` keyword by their index. The
          first item in `markdownEnumDescriptions` maps to the first item in `enum` and so on.

          Defines a friendly error message to raise when a schema or subschema fails validation
          for the `pattern` keyword.

          By default, when a value fails validation for the `pattern` keyword, VS Code raises an
          error that informs the user that the value is invalid for the given regular expression,
          which it displays in the message.

          Reading and parsing regular expressions can be difficult even for experienced users. You
          can define the `patternErrorMessage` keyword to provide better information to the user
          about the expected pattern for the string value.

          Defines an alternate string to use when sorting a suggestion.

          By default, suggestions are displayed in alphabetical order. You can define the
          `suggestSortText` keyword to change how the suggestions are sorted. For example, in
          the following schema, VS Code will suggest the `baz`, then `bar`, then `foo` properties:

          ```json
