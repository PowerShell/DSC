### Changed

- Changed the `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell` adapter to only handle PowerShell DSC Resources
  implemented as classes and remove the dependency on the **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module.
  The `Microsoft.Windows/WindowsPowerShell` adapter continues to work with classic PSDSC resources.
  Neither adapter supports composite PSDSC resources. This change simplified the code and coincided
  with ensuring that the `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell` adapter works correctly on Linux and macOS as
  well as Windows. This change also brought performance improvements to the adapter, speeding up
  resource invocation and discovery.

### Added

- Added the [`--what-if` (`-w`)][p8-01] option to the [dsc config set][cmd-cset] command. When you
  call `dsc config set` with the `--what-if` option, DSC doesn't actually invoke the resources to
  enforce the desired state. Instead, it returns the expected output for the command, showing the
  before and after state for each resource instance.

  The output for the `dsc config set` operation with the `--what-if` operation is the same as an
  [actual configuration set operation][p8-02], except that the metadata field
  [executionType][p8-03] is set to `WhatIf` instead of `Actual`.

  By default, the generated output is synthetic, based on the results of the resources' `test`
  operation. Resources can define the [whatIf][p8-04] property in their resource manifest to
  participate in what-if operations, reporting more specifically how they will change the system.
  For example, participating resources could indicate whether an actual set operation will require
  a reboot or whether the current user has the correct permissions to manage that resource
  instance.

  Participating resources have the [WhatIf capability][p8-05].

- Added support for [importer resources][p8-06]. These resources resolve external sources to a
  nested DSC Configuration document. The resolved instances are processed as nested resource
  instances.

  This required some updates to the schemas, all backwards-compatible:

  - Added a new [resourceKind][p8-07] named `Import`.
  - Added the [resolve][p8-08] command to resource manifests.
  - Added the new [`Resolve`][p8-09] capability, returned in the output for the
    [dsc resource list][cmd-rlist] command when DSC discovers an importer resource.

  </details>

- Added the `Microsoft.DSC/Include` importer resource to resolve instances from an external
  configuration document. The resolved instances are processed as nested instances for the
  `Microsoft.DSC/Include` resource instance.
  
  You can use this resource to write smaller configuration documents and compose them as needed.
  For example, you could define a security baseline and a web server configuration separately, then
  combine them for a given application:

  ```yaml
  $schema: &schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2024/04/config/document.json
  resources:
  # Group of included baseline configurations
  - name: Baselines
    type: Microsoft.DSC/Group
    properties:
      $schema: *schema
      resources:
      - name: Security Baseline
        type: Microsoft.DSC/Include
        properties:
          configurationFile: security_baseline.dsc.yaml
          parametersFile:    security_baseline.parameters.yaml
      - name: Web Server Baseline
        type: Microsoft.DSC/Include
        properties:
          configurationFile: web_baseline.dsc.yaml
          parametersFile:    web_baseline.parameters.yaml
        dependsOn:
          - "[resourceId('Microsoft.DSC/Include', 'Security Baseline')]"

  # application configuration instances, all depend on the baselines
  - name: Application configuration
    type: MyApp/Settings
    properties:
      someSetting: someValue
    dependsOn:
      - "[resourceId('Microsoft.DSC/Group', 'Baselines')]"
  ```

  </details>

- Added caching for PowerShell Desired State Configuration (PSDSC) resources when using the
  `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell` and `Microsoft.Windows/PowerShell` adapters. The adapters use the
  cache to speed up resource discovery. The performance improvement reduced the resource list time
  under tests from eight seconds to two seconds, and reduced invocation operation times by half.

  The adapters cache the resources in the following locations, depending on your platform:

  |            Adapter             | Platform |                      Path                       |
  | :----------------------------: | :------: | :---------------------------------------------- |
  |   `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell`   |  Linux   | `$HOME/.dsc/PSAdapterCache.json`                |
  |   `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell`   |  macOS   | `$HOME/.dsc/PSAdapterCache.json`                |
  |   `Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell`   | Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsc\PSAdapterCache.json`        |
  | `Microsoft.Windows/PowerShell` | Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsc\WindowsPSAdapterCache.json` |

  The adapters check whether the cache is stale on each run and refresh it if:

  - The `PSModulePath` environmental variable is updated.
  - Any module is added or removed from the `PSModulePath`.
  - Any related files in a cached PSDSC resource module has been updated since the cache was
    written. The adapter watches the `LastWriteTime` of module files with the following extensions:
    `.ps1`, `.psd1`, `.psm1`, and `.mof`.

- Added the `DSC.PackageManagement/Apt` resource for managing software on systems that use the
  advanced package tool (APT). In this release, you can use the resource to:

  - Install the latest version of a package.
  - Uninstall a package.
  - Get the current state of a package.
  - Export every installed package as a DSC resource instance.

- Added the `Microsoft.DSC.Experimental/SystemctlService` class-based PSDSC resource. It has the
  `Get` and `Export` [capabilities][p8-10]. You can use it on Linux systems that manage services
  with SystemD and `systemctl`. In this release, it doesn't support setting services.

### Fixed

- Fixed the JSON Schema for [exit codes][p8-11] in the resource manifest to support negative
  integers. Prior to this release, the DSC engine supported negative exit codes but the JSON Schema
  forbid them.

  - PRs: [#410][#410]

  </details>

- Fixed the behavior of the [int()][int()] configuration function to error when given an input
  value other than a string or integer. Prior to this release, when you specified a number with
  a fractional part as input for the function, it coerced the input value to an integer representing
  the fractional part. Starting with this release, the `int()` function raises an invalid input
  error when the input value isn't a string or an integer.

  - Issues: [#390][#390]
  - PRs: [#438][#438]

- Fixed the implementation to retrieve non-zero exit code descriptions for resource errors from the
  resource manifest, if defined. Prior to this release, these error descriptions weren't surfaced.

### Changed

- The version segment of the schema URIs for DSC have been updated from `2023/10` to `2024/04` to
  accommodate breaking schema changes from the schemas that `alpha.5` used. You can find more
  information about the specific changes to the schemas in the following changelog entries:

  - [Renamed 'providers' to 'adapters'](#rename-provider-to-adapter)
  - [Added the 'delete' operation for resources](#add-delete-operation)
  - [Added the option to specify a required security context for a configuration document](#add-elevation-requirement)
  - [Add option to specify a JSON input argument for resource commands](#add-json-input-arg)
  - [Add 'kind' property to resource manifests](#add-kind-property)
  - [Camel-cased 'SecureObject' and 'SecureString' parameter types](#camel-casing-secure-types)
  - [Add 'capabilities' to 'dsc resource list' output](#add-capabilities)
  - [Added metadata to config and resource output](#add-metadata-output)

  Update your configuration documents and resource manifests to use the following URIs for the
  `$schema` keyword:

  ```yaml
  Canonical URI for configuration documents: >-
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2024/04/config/document.json

- <a id="rename-provider-to-adapter"></a>

  In this release, the term `DSC Resource Provider` is replaced with the more semantically accurate
  `DSC Resource Adapter`. These resources enable users to leverage resources that don't define a
  DSC Resource Manifest with DSC, like PSDSC resources - they're _adapters_ between DSCv3 and
  resources defined in a different way.

  Beyond using different terminology in the documentation, this change also renamed the resource
  manifest property `provider` to [adapter][p7-01], and the `requires` property in the output for
  `dsc resource list` has been renamed to [requireAdapter][p7-02].

- The [envvar()][envvar()] function now raises an error when the specified environment variable
  doesn't exist instead of returning an empty string. This change helps reduce unexpected and
  difficult to diagnose errors when a configuration expects a value from the environment variable.

- Renamed the `DscConfigRoot` environment variable to `DSC_CONFIG_ROOT`. DSC now correctly
  absolutizes the variable, even when the path to a configuration document is a relative path. DSC
  also raises a warning when you define the environment variable outside of DSC before overriding
  it.

  </details>

- Updated the default behavior of the [dsc resource list][cmd-rlist] command and added the new
  [--adapter][p7-04] option to the command.

  Prior to this release, the command always called the `list` command for any discovered adapters,
  even when searching for a non-adapted resource by name. Enumerating the adapted resources can be
  a slow process, so the command no longer calls the adapters to list their adapted resources by
  default.

  Instead, you can use the `--adapter` option to specify a filter for the adapters you want to list
  adapted resources for. Specify the fully qualified type name of an adapter or a string including
  wildcards (`*`) to use as a filter for adapter names. You can specify the filter `*` to have DSC
  call the `list` operation for every discovered adapter, returning all adapted resources.

  For more information, see [dsc resource list][cmd-rlist].

  kind and capabilities. The capabilities column in the table uses bit flags for the display to
  keep the column width manageable.

### Added

- <a id="add-delete-operation" /></a> Added the [dsc resource delete][cmd-rdelete] command and the
  [delete][p7-05] operation property to the resource manifest. Prior to this release, resources had
  to handle deleting resources as part of their `set` operation, and the development guidance was
  to use the [_exist][p7-06] standard property to indicate whether a resource should exist.

  Now, resource authors can indicate through the resource manifest whether the resource supports
  the `delete` operation with a separate command or as part of the `set` operation. It can be
  simpler to implement a separate `delete` operation than to handle deleting instances as part of
  `set`. You can implement your resource to have an explicit `delete` command and handle deleting
  instances as part of a `set` operation.

  You can also use the `dsc resource delete` command to delete instances one at a time. For this
  command, the JSON input defines the filter to pass to the resource for deleting the instance. For
  more information, see [dsc resource delete command reference][cmd-rdelete].

  If your resource handles deleting instances as part of `set`, use the [handlesExist][p7-07]
  property to tell DSC so. When this property is `true`, the resource has the
  [SetHandlesExist capability][p7-08].

  If your resource has a separate command for deleting instances, use the [delete][p7-05] property
  in your resource manifest to tell DSC and other tools how to invoke the operation. When this
  property is defined, the resource has the [Delete capability][p7-09].

  If your resource handles deleting instances, you should add the `_exist` standard property to the
  resource's [instance schema][p7-10]. While you can use any property name for this, DSC is only aware of
  deletion operations when you use the `_exist` property. DSC won't know to call the `delete`
  operation for resources that don't have the [SetHandlesExist][p7-08] capability.

  For resources that implement `delete` but don't handle `_exist` in the `set` operation, DSC can
  now invoke the delete operation as-needed in a configuration whenever it enforces the desired
  state for an instance of a resource with the `_exist` property set to `false`.

  </details>

- <a id="add-elevation-requirement" /></a> Added the option to specify whether a configuration
  document requires root or elevated permissions. Now, you can define the `securityContext`
  metadata property under the `Microsoft.DSC` namespace in a configuration document to specify
  which security context to use:

  - `Current` - Any security context. This is the default if you don't specify this property in a
    configuration document.
  - `Elevated` - Elevated as root or an administrator.
  - `Restricted` - Not elevated as root or an administrator.

  For example, the following metadata at the top of a configuration document indicates that DSC
  must run as a normal user account, not root or administrator:

  ```yaml
  metadata:
    Microsoft.DSC:
      securityContext: restricted
  ```

  </details>

- <a id="add-json-input-arg" /></a> Added the option to define a JSON input argument for resource
  commands. When you define the `args` list for the following commands, you can now define a
  special argument that the command expects to receive the compressed JSON data for:

  - [delete][p7-12]
  - [export][p7-13]
  - [get][p7-14]
  - [set][p7-15]
  - [test][p7-16]
  - [validate][p7-17]

  DSC sends data to these commands in three ways:

  1. When `input` is `stdin`, DSC sends the data as a string representing the data as a compressed
     JSON object without spaces or newlines between the object properties.
  1. When `input` is `env`, DSC sends the data as environment variables. It creates an environment
     variable for each property in the input data object, using the name and value of the property.
  1. When the `args` array includes a JSON input argument definition, DSC sends the data as a
     string representing the data as a compressed JSON object to the specified argument.

  If you don't define the `input` property and don't define a JSON input argument, DSC can't pass
  the input JSON to the resource. You can only define one JSON input argument for a command.

  You must define the `input` property, one JSON input argument in the `args` property array, or
  both. For more information, see the relevant schema documentation for the command property.

- <a id="added-config-functions"/></a> Added configuration functions:

  - New mathematics functions include [add()][add()], [div()][div()], [max()][max()],
    [min()][min()], [mod()][mod()], [mul()][mul()], and [sub()][sub()]. The mathematics functions
    only operate on integer values.

  - The [reference()][reference()] function enables you to reference the result output for other
    resources, so you can use properties of one resource instance as values for another. The
    `reference()` function only works for resources that DSC has already managed in a
    configuration. You should always add the resource you're referencing with the `reference()`
    function to the [dependsOn][p7-18] list for the instance using the reference.

  - The [createArray()][createArray()] function enables you to create arrays of a given type from
    values.

  - The [int()][int()] function enables you to convert strings and numbers with fractional parts
    into integers.

- <a id="add-kind-property" /></a> Added the [kind][p7-19] property to the resource manifest schema
  and the [output][p7-20] for the [dsc resource list][cmd-rlist] command. This property indicates
  whether the resource is a [group resource][p7-21] (`Group`), an [adapter resource][p7-22]
  (`Adapter`), or neither (`Resource`). For more information, see
  [DSC Resource kind schema reference][p7-23].

  This property is mandatory in the resource manifest for group resources. If your resource
  manifest doesn't define the `kind` property, DSC can infer whether the resource is an adapter
  resource or not. Microsoft recommends always explicitly defining this property in resource
  manifests, because the schema can apply enhanced validation based on the value of the `kind`
  property.

- Added parsing for [configuration functions][cfuncs] in the [default values][p7-31] of parameters.
  Prior to this release, DSC interpreted configuration functions in parameter default values as
  literal strings.

- Added type validation for parameter [default values][p7-31]. Prior to this release, DSC didn't
  validate that the default value for a parameter was valid for the parameter's [type][p7-32].

  </details>

- Added support for resources to send trace information to DSC during command execution. DSC
  Resources can emit JSON objects to stderr. If the object has a property in the following list
  with a string value, DSC interprets the emitted object as a message of the matching level:
  `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Debug`, `Trace`.

  For example, DSC would interpret a resource emitting the following JSON to stderr as a warning:

  ```json
  {"Warning":"Unable to access remote store, using cached local package data only"}
  ```

  DSC emits these messages along with its own messages when the specified trace level for the
  command is equal to or lower than the message's level.

  For more information about trace levels, see the [--trace-level][p7-33] option for the
  [dsc][cmd] root command.

  executed silently.

  </details>

- Added functionality to insert metadata for adapter resources to indicate if the incoming data is
  for a configuration instead of direct resource invocation. Prior to this release, adapters had no
  way of discerning between a single-instance call for a configuration and a direct resource
  invocation.

  With this change, DSC inserts the following into the data object sent to the adapter during a
  `dsc config` command:

  ```json
  "metadata": {
    "Microsoft.DSC": {
      "context": "Configuration"
    }
  }
  ```

  Adapters can then check whether this value is set in the input data and handle it as-needed.

## [v3.0.0-alpha.5][release-v3.0.0-alpha.5] - 2024-02-27

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.5` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.5].

<!-- Release links -->
[release-v3.0.0-alpha.5]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.5 "Link to the DSC v3.0.0-alpha.5 release on GitHub"
[compare-v3.0.0-alpha.5]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/compare/v3.0.0-alpha.4...v3.0.0-alpha.5

### Changed

- Updated the options for the `dsc` root command:

  - Removed the global `--format` option, which controls the output format. Now, the relevant
    subcommands that return formattable output have the `--format` option (short option as `-f`)
    added to them.
  - Removed the global `--input` and `--input-file` options. Now, the `config` subcommands have the
    `--document` and `--path` options for specifying the configuration document as a string or from
    a file. The relevant `resource` subcommands have the `--input` and `--path` options for
    specifying the instance properties as a string or from a file.
  - The `--logging-level` option is renamed to [--trace-level][a5.05] with the short name `-l`. The
    default trace level is now `warning` instead of `info`.
  - Added the [--trace-format][a5.06] option with the `-f` short name. This option enables you to
    choose the format for the trace messages emitted to stderr. By default, the messages are
    emitted as lines of text with console colors. You can set this option to `plaintext` to emit
    the messages without console colors or to `json` to emit the messages as JSON objects.

    The trace messaging is also updated to only emit source files and line numbers for the `debug`
    and `trace` levels.

  </details>

- Updated the JSON schemas for the [get][a5.07], [set][a5.08], and [test][a5.09] output data. This
  change corrects an issue with how DSC surfaced information about instances nested inside group
  and adapter resources. Now when you review the output, you'll be able to see the results for each
  nested instance instead of a confusing object that loses the nested instance type and name
  information.

  This schema change is backwards compatible.

- Changed the [concat][a5.10] configuration function to match the behavior of the ARM template
  function. The `concat()` function now only accepts strings or arrays of strings as input values.
  It raises an error if the input values are not of the same type.

### Added

- Implemented support for referencing parameters in a configuration with the [parameters()][a5.01]
  configuration function. This enables you to take advantage of parameterized configurations. Until
  this release, you could define but not reference parameters.

  Now, you can use the [--parameters][a5.02] and [--parameters-file][a5.03] options with the
  [dsc config][a5.04] commands to pass values for any parameter defined in the configuration
  document.

  </details>

- Added support for authoring DSC Resource manifests in YAML. DSC now recognizes resource manifests
  that use the `.dsc.resource.yml` or `.dsc.resource.yaml` file extension instead of only
  `.dsc.resource.json`.

  <details><summary>Related work Items</summary>

  - Issues: [#129][#129]
  - PRs: [#311][#311]

  </details>

- Added the [DSCConfigRoot][a5.11] environment variable and the
  [envvar() configuration function][a5.12] to enable users to reference files and folders relative
  to the folder containing the configuration document. DSC automatically and only creates the
  `DSCConfigRoot` environment variable when you use the `--path` option to specify the
  configuration document instead of passing the document as a string from stdin or with the
  `--document` option.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In this release, DSC doesn't expand the specified path to an absolute path. You should always
  > specify the full path to the configuration document if you want to reference the
  > `DSCConfigRoot` variable in your configuration. Further, DSC always sets the value for this
  > environment variable when you use the `--path` option. If the environment variable is already
  > set, it overrides it silently.
  >
  > In a future release, the variable will be renamed to `DSC_CONFIG_ROOT` and DSC will
  > automatically expand relative paths into absolute paths when setting the environment variable.
  > It will also emit a warning when it overrides the variable.

  </details>

- Added support for using the [dsc config export][cmd-cexport] and
  [dsc resource export][cmd-rexport] commands with the PowerShell adapter resource. PSDSC resources
  can now participate in the `export` command if they define a static method that returns an array
  of the PSDSC resource class.

  <details><summary>Related work Items</summary>

  - Issues: [#183][#183]
  - PRs: [#307][#307]

  </details>

- Added the `methods` column to the default table view for the console output of the
  [dsc resource list][cmd-rlist] command. This new column indicates which methods the resource
  explicitly implements. Valid values include `get`, `set`, `test`, and `export`. This information
  is only available in the table view. It isn't part of the output object for the command. If you
  use the [--format][a5.16] parameter, capture the command output, or redirect the output, the
  `methods` information isn't included.

  Resources that don't implement `test` rely on DSC's synthetic test behavior instead. They can
  still be used for test and set operations.

  Resources that don't implement `export` can't be used with the `dsc config export` or
  `dsc resource export` commands.

  Resources that don't implement `set` can be used for auditing, but not `dsc resource set`. They
  can be used with the `dsc config set` command, but only if they're nested inside a
  `DSC/AssertionGroup` instance.

  </details>

- Added an prototype for a WMI resource adapter to enable users to query WMI. The adapter is
  disabled by default, as enumerating the WMI resources can have a performance impact. To enable
  it, rename the resource manifest from `wmigroup.dsc.resource.json.optout` to
  `wmigroup.dsc.resource.json`.

## [v3.0.0-alpha.4][release-v3.0.0-alpha.4] - 2023-11-14

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.4` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.4].

<!-- Release links -->
[release-v3.0.0-alpha.4]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.4 "Link to the DSC v3.0.0-alpha.4 release on GitHub"

### Changed

- Updated the canonical version of the schema URIs from `2023/08` to `2023/10`, as this release
  includes breaking changes for the schemas.

  As part of this change, the `$schema` keyword for both [configuration documents][a4.01] and
  [resource manifests][a4.02] accepts any valid URI for the schemas, instead of only one. Now, you
  can set the value for the keyword to the unbundled schema, the bundled schema, or the enhanced
  authoring schema for any supported version.

- Replaced the `_ensure` well-known property with the boolean [_exist][a4.03] property. This
  improves the semantics for users and simplifies implementation for resources, replacing the
  string enum values `Present` and `Absent` with `true` and `false` respectively.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#202][#202]
  - PRs: [#206][#206]

  </details>

- Updated the `Microsoft.Windows/Registry` resource to use the `_exist` property instead of
  `_ensure` and updated the output to be idiomatic for a DSC Resource.

  - Issues: [#162][#162]
  - PRs: [#206][#206]

  </details>

- When a user presses the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key combination, DSC now recursively
  terminates all child processes before exiting. This helps prevent dangling processes that were
  previously unhandled by the interrupt event.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#213][#213]

  </details>

### Added

- Added the `--input` and `--input-file` global options to the root `dsc` command. Now, you
  can pass input to DSC from a variable or file instead of piping from stdin.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#130][#130]
  - PRs: [#217][#217]

  </details>

- Added the `arg` value as an option for defining how a command-based DSC Resource expects to
  receive input. This enables resource authors to define resources that handle DSC passing the
  instance JSON as an argument.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#213][#213]

  </details>

- Added the new [completer][a4.04] command enables users to add shell completions for DSC to their
  shell. The command supports completions for Bash, Elvish, fish, PowerShell, and ZSH.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#186][#186]
  - PRs: [#216][#216]

  </details>

- DSC now emits log messages to the stderr stream. This can make it easier to understand what DSC
  is doing. This doesn't affect the data output. By default, DSC emits errors, warnings, and
  informational messages, but not debug or trace messaging. You can control the level of the
  logging with the new `--logging-level` option on the root `dsc` command.

    - [#107][#107]
    - [#158][#158]
  - PRs:
    - [#211][#211]
    - [#248][#248]

  </details>

- Added optimizations for the resource discovery process that runs before most `dsc` commands.
  These optimizations significantly reduce the command execution duration, especially for the
  `dsc resource *` commands, which rarely need to run a full discovery for resources.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#173][#173]
  - PRs: [#240][#240]

  </details>

- Added initial [configuration document functions][a4.05] to DSC. You can now use the
  [base64()][a4.06], [concat()][a4.07], and [resourceId()][a4.08] functions in the configuration
  document.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `resourceId` function has been reimplemented as a document function instead of a special
  > case, but it has the same functionality and parameters.

  - Issues: [#57][#57]
  - PRs:
    - [#241][#241]
    - [#252][#252]

  </details>

### Fixed

- The `--format` option now works as users expect when the output is redirected or saved to a
  variable. Before this fix, DSC always returned JSON output, even when the user wanted to save
  the output as YAML. With this fix, the specified format is respected.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#215][#215]

  </details>

- The `DSC/PowerShellGroup` resource now correctly returns the _labels_ for enumerations instead of
  their integer value, making it easier to understand and compare results.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#159][#159]
  - PRs: [#208][#208]

  </details>

- DSC no longer terminates during discovery when a resource errors unless the erroring resource is
  being used for the command. DSC still terminates on a resource error during discovery under the
  following conditions:

  - When the erroring resource type is the same as the value of the `--resource` option for a
    `dsc resource *` command.
  - When an instance in the configuration document uses the erroring resource type for a
    `dsc config *` command.

  DSC emits the resource errors during discovery as warning messages for the `dsc resource list`
  command. In all other cases, DSC emits the errors as debug messages.

### Changed

- Replaced the `manifestVersion` property for resource manifests with [$schema][a3.01]. Instead of
  specifying a semantic version, resources need to indicate which canonical schema DSC should use
  to validate and process the manifest.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#127][#127]
  - PRs: [#199][#199]

  </details>

- Updated the `preTest` property for the `set` command in resource manifests to
  [implementsPretest][a3.02] to more make the manifest easier to read and understand.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#197][#197]

  </details>

- The [dsc resource set][cmd-rset] command no longer tests the resource instance before invoking the
  `set` operation. This simplifies the behavior for the command and adheres more accurately to the
  implied contract for directly invoking a resource with DSC.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#98][#98]
  - PRs: [#197][#197]

  </details>

- Replaced the `args` option with `env` for defining how a command-based resource expects to
  receive input for the [get][a3.04], [set][a3.05], and [test][a3.06] commands in the resource
  manifest.

  The `args` option was never implemented. Instead, resource authors can set the `input` property
  to `env` to indicate that the resource expects input as environmental variables.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#198][#198]

  </details>

- The `input` property for the [get][a3.04] command in a resource manifest no longer has a default
  value. Instead, when a resource doesn't define `input` for the `get` command, DSC doesn't send
  any input to the resource for that command.

### Changed

- The [$schema][a2.14] value for configuration documents now points to the canonical published
  schema URI,
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2023/08/config/document.json`.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#156][#156]

  one or more other instances in the document.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#45][#45]
  - PRs: [#175][#175]

- Added the [export][a2.02] property to the resource manifest schema, indicating that the resource
  is exportable and defining how DSC can retrieve the current state for every instance of the
  resource.

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

- Added the [dsc config export][cmd-cexport] command to convert an input configuration document
  defining a list of resource types into a usable configuration document that defines the current
  state for every instance of those resources.

- Added handling for the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key combination to cancel a DSC operation.
  When `dsc` cancels an operation due to this key-press, it indicates that the operation was
  cancelled with [exit code 6][a2.07].

- Added support for using the [DSC_RESOURCE_PATH environment variable][a2.08] to define a list of
  folders to search for command-based DSC Resource manifests. When `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` is defined,
  DSC searches those folders for resources and ignores the `PATH` variable for resource discovery.

- The `DSC/AssertionGroup`, `DSC/Group`, and `DSC/ParallelGroup` resources now define semantic exit
  codes in their manifests. These resources now indicate that they use the same
  [exit codes as the dsc command][a2.08].

- Added type validation in the schema for the [defaultValue][a2.09] and [allowedValues][a2.10]
  properties of [configuration document parameters][a2.11] to improve the authoring experience.
  Now, when a parameter defines values for these properties that are incompatible with the defined
  data type, validation raises an error indicating that the values are invalid and why.

- Enhanced VS Code-specific schemas for configuration documents and resource manifests to improve
  the authoring experience. The enhanced schemas use keywords only supported by VS Code to:

  - Render Markdown help information for properties and enums.
  - Provide contextual error messages when a value fails pattern validation.
  - Define default snippets to autocomplete values.

  These schemas are non-canonical and should only be used for authoring. For more information, see
  [Authoring with enhanced schemas][a2.12].

- Documentation to the [Microsoft/OSInfo][a2.13] resource instance schema and command-line tool to
  provide contextual help about the properties the resource can validate.

### Fixed

- The data-type conditionals for the [configuration parameters][a2.11] schema so that the `min*`
  and `max*` keywords apply to the correct data types. Previously, the logic prevented them from
  ever applying.

- Using the `registry find` command no longer raises a panic error due to conflicting option
  definitions on the command.
